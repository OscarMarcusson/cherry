## TL;DR
A short description of the issue. The fewer words the better, as long as the issue is clearly defined. For example:
> Compiler throws exception for "p = ⊁⬩≎⌲❽↴"
> No output when input is UTF-16 encoded
Sometimes more information is needed of course, and it's ok to have a few lines of text here, but always try to keep it to a minimum.

## Technical information needed to reproduce the bug
* Code
* Compiler arguments.
* Any other relevant information needed to reproduce the bug if the above are not enough

For example:
> Code: p.some_style = 12345
> Arguments: -r "inputfile.txt"
> Only happens in real-time mode.


## Expected behavior**
If not obvious, please describe the expected behaviour. Exceptions, crashes, no output file being generated, or other similar things are seen as obvious and you do not have to write anything.

Example:
> Expected output HTML to look like <a class="test"></a> when input is "a.test".


## Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain the issue. This is useful if the output code is not obviously incorrect but still looks wrong when viewing the rendered result.


## Device information
Sometimes device information may be needed. If an issue with the output is only seen on a phone for example, we need to know which phone / OS it is, as well as the browser used. We also need to know the version of both.
