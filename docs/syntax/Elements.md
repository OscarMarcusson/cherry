# Core Syntax
The syntax is built to match HTML in terms of content, but with different syntax. 

## Element declaration
In its most simple way, you could view it as this:

**Simplified**
```ini
div
p = Hello World
p = "String version of Hello World, if spaces should be included at the start or end like this  "
```
**HTML**
```HTML
<div></div>
<p>Hello World</p>
<p>String version of Hello World, if spaces should be included at the start or end like this&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
```
